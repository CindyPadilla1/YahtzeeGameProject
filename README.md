# Yahtzee Game (JavaScript)

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Yahtzee game using plain JavaScript.
It was completed as a coursework assignment to practice core programming concepts such as control flow, arrays, functions, and basic game logic without using external frameworks.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Features
- Dice rolling and scoring logic
- Turn-based gameplay
- Score tracking based on Yahtzee rules
- Basic user interaction through the browser

## Notes
- This is a course project created for learning purposes
- The game focuses on JavaScript logic rather than advanced UI design
- Code may not be optimized for production use

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Play the game directly in the browser

## What I Learned
- Implementing game logic using JavaScript
- Working with arrays and conditional logic
- Managing application state in a small project
- Translating game rules into code
